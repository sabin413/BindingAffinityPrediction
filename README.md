# BindingAffinityPrediction
This project involves data mining, preprocessing, and building XGBoost and Neural Network classifiers for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction. Following are the steps followed - 
1. Data mining from the web using Python - Scarpe unstructured 20 GB data and extract only the useful data
2. Convert the raw data into a data frame and analyze it
3. Do data preprocessing, feature engineering, and recalling
4. Build a XGBoost Classifier on ScikitLearn
5. Build a Neural Network Classifier on Keras and TensorFlow
